[[Greed and power of corporations#Ready player one]]


Escapism,
Of course the oasis is a form of escapism but even in the oasis people try to escape to the past, the gunters obsession with the 80s

**Wade wats**


**Egg**
The easter egg symbolises hope rebirth and possibility.
**Key**
The keys are symbol of power and knowlegde to obtain it you have to show you have that knowledge
**IOI**
Is a symbol of greed corruption

**Coming of age**
Wade starts the story of with having selfish reasons for wanting the egg, to escape poverty and get a better life.
Hoewever in the story his motives change especially when art3mis breaks up with him
and then when IOI gets the crystal key and murders daito
He changes from selfish reasons to wanting to safe the oasis from IOI and sorrento
