#Boek 
****
**Tolkien has said that you shouldnt analyse the hobbit as an allegory of any kind, there is NO hidden meanings**


**Genre**
[[Medieval Romance#The hobbit]]

**Thorin**
Thorins personality lacks to bilbo's as he fails to be heroic despite his role al leader he does not deserve it as he irrationality after finding the treasure brings out his true nature. in the end he does seem redemptive.

**Gandalf**
Gandalf has the archetype of wise old man similar to **merlin** from arthurian legends. Gandalf keeps leaving because otherwise biblo cant become the hero.
And he sometimes serves as a deus ex machina

**Themes**
Heroism
coming of age
[[Greed]]

**Bilbo and the treasure**
The part in which bilbo steals a cup from the treasure is a reference to beowulf wherin a thief in which a thief rouses the wrath of a dragon by stealing a cup from its hoard and the dragon lays waste to beowulfs land.


Apart from beowulf the story is also similar to sir gawain and the green knight.

**The end**
Gandalf and Balin visit Bilbo years later, and he learns how things have turned out under the mountain, where a new master has taken charge of Lake-town and all are living in peace and prosperity. The old songs, Bilbo notes, “have turned out to be true, after a fashion” (286), and Gandalf chides him for his skepticism. Prophecies, the wizard says, are no less true just because one is himself involved with bringing them to pass. The question raised has to do with destiny and free will, and Tolkien hints here at a characteristically medieval view of the matter.
